# Model Fitness Customer Churn Analysis

## 📄 Project Description

Model Fitness, a chain of gyms, is developing a data‑driven customer engagement strategy. To combat customer churn (“silent departures”),  this analysis:

1. **Predicts** each member’s probability of churn in the next month.  
2. **Profiles** key customer segments and describes their main characteristics.  
3. **Identifies** the most impactful factors driving churn.  
4. **Recommends** retention measures, including target groups and service improvements.

Churn is defined here as a member who fails to visit the gym for a full month. Although exceptions (e.g., vacations) exist, this definition captures the typical “quiet” departure.

## 🔍 Analysis Objectives

1. **Churn Probability Modeling**  
   - Train and evaluate a classification model (e.g., logistic regression, random forest).  
   - Calibrate and interpret predicted probabilities.

2. **Customer Profiling**  
   - Segment members by usage patterns, demographics, and engagement metrics.  
   - Highlight high‑risk vs. loyal cohorts.

3. **Feature Importance**  
   - Analyze which behavioral and demographic features correlate most strongly with churn.  

4. **Strategic Recommendations**  
   - Define target segments for proactive outreach.  
   - Suggest personalized retention actions (e.g., tailored offers, check‑in reminders).  
   - Document any additional patterns observed (e.g., seasonal drop‑off).
